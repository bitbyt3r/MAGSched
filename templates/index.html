<h1 id="magsched">MAGSched</h1>
<p>Schedule caching server supporting multiple upstreams.</p>
<p>The main goal is to avoid having any API usage limits that external providers impose by self hosting a local copy of the schedule. Additionally, it provides a very simple interface for downstream consumers.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The following environment variables are used to configure the backend:</p>
<ul>
<li>REDIS_HOST - The IP/hostname of the redis instance</li>
<li>REDIS_PORT - The port to use for redis</li>
<li>REDIS_DB - The DB number to use for redis (generally a number from 0-15)</li>
<li>REFRESH_DELAY - How long to wait between backend polls</li>
<li>BACKENDS - A json string specifying which backend services to pull from in ascending order of priority</li>
</ul>
<p>BACKENDS takes a list of objects in this format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
    {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test Guidebook&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;guidebook&quot;,
        &quot;apikey&quot;: &quot;aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff.aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff&quot;,
        &quot;guide&quot;: &quot;183391&quot;
    },
    {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Google Sheet&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sheets&quot;,
        &quot;sheet&quot;: &quot;1dTp07uGTokckyXtNUGLRnK634twzaaKUF0Rp8XQGl20&quot;,
        &quot;key&quot;: &quot;aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff&quot;,
        &quot;credentials&quot;: &quot;&quot;
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, <code>sheets</code> and <code>guidebook</code> types are supported. Data pulled from services later in the list of backends will override data from earlier ones if they contain the same IDs. In this example, you could use Google Sheets to add or edit schedule entries from Guidebook.</p>
<h3 id="guidebook-configuration">Guidebook Configuration</h3>
<p>Guidebook requires an API key and a guide number, both as strings. Guidebook does not have permissions controls on API keys, so be very careful with them.</p>
<h3 id="google-sheets-configuration">Google Sheets Configuration</h3>
<p>Google sheets requires a sheet ID which can be pulled from the URL of a sheet.</p>
<p>Additionally it requires a Google developer API key. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python">https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python</a> for docs on setting up a key for this.</p>
<p>Finally, sheets requires credentials that have been authorized to access the user&#39;s account. If you start the server locally with credentials set to an empty string it will launch a browser window interactively to allow you to authorize it to access sheets on your account. Once that is complete, it will save the session key to the database and continually refresh it. It will also print out the value needed for this variable so that you can copy it to a remote server. If this server gets any serious use I&#39;ll probably implement the flow server side, but it should be at most a once per year thing.</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>The REST API has the following endpoints:</p>
<h3 id="get-sessions">GET /sessions</h3>
<p>Returns a list of sessions that are scheduled.</p>

<p><code>time_range_start</code> and <code>time_range_end</code> allow you to request results from a range of time. You can specify the endpoints in a few ways.</p>
<p>Each end of the range can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unix epoch timestamp</li>
<li>The literal word &quot;now&quot;</li>
<li>A relative number of seconds to now with a +/- sign in front</li>
</ul>
<p>To get the next hour of events use <code>time_range_start=now&amp;time_range_end=+3600</code> for example. To get events starting one hour ago until the end of the schedule use <code>time_range_start=-3600</code>.</p>
